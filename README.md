# IoT Rapid Prototyping - OUTDATED

This repository holds references for you to get your devices online as easily as possible and how to interact with it.
At the moment this is most easily achieved via the automatically generated python code and deployment (to a Seluxit Porcupine) by "IoT Rapid Prototyping" wapp at http://wappsto.com. You may need to install the wapp from the store (free of charge).

You'll find solutions to workshop challenges and walkthroughs in the relevant folders.

You can also find examples on how to implement this with peripherals connected to a Raspberry Pi.
